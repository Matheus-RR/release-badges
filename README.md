# Release Badges

**Live release health badges for 300+ software products. Always current, zero maintenance.**

Track the release health of your entire stack at a glance. These badges pull real-time data from [ReleaseRun](https://releaserun.com) and update automatically — no configuration, no API keys, no maintenance.

## Badge Types

| **EOL Status** | End-of-life / support status | ![Python 3.13 EOL](https://img.releaserun.com/badge/eol/python/3.13.svg) |
| **CVE Count** | Known vulnerabilities | ![Python 3.13 CVE](https://img.releaserun.com/badge/cve/python/3.13.svg) |
| **Version Health** | Health for a specific version | ![Python 3.12 Health](https://img.releaserun.com/badge/health/python/3.12.svg) |

## How It Works

Badges are served as SVGs from `img.releaserun.com`. Data is sourced from:
- [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date) — release cycles, EOL dates, latest versions
- [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) — CVE vulnerability data
- Direct vendor APIs where available

Badges are cached with multi-layer caching (in-memory → HTTP → CDN) and update within minutes of upstream changes.
